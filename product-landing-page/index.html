                <p>Hi! My name is Nikita Sazonov and I would like to tell you about the game which I work on. This is the strategy game about the management of people, processes and business development.<br>You will feel how to be a top-manager of big corporation,
                    how it is important to work with your staff and develop the people and how much your success depends on them.<br>I've worked for 10 years for different big companies on different positions, so I will try to put everything I faced with,
                    or even more in my game. Please subscribe on my channel to stay tuned.</p>
